/// Arrow ODBC reader. Implements the [`arrow::record_batch::RecordBatchReader`] trait so it can be
/// used to fill Arrow arrays from an ODBC data source. Similar to [`crate::OdbcReader`], yet
/// [`ConcurrentOdbcReader`] fetches ODBC batches in a second transit buffer eagerly from the
/// database in a dedicated system thread. This allows the allocation of the Arrow arrays and your
/// application logic to run on the main thread, while fetching the batches from the source happens
/// concurrently. You need twice the memory for the transit buffer for this strategy, since one is
/// may be in use by the main thread in order to copy values into arrow arrays, while the other is
/// used to write values from the database.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use arrow_odbc::{odbc_api::{Environment, ConnectionOptions}, OdbcReaderBuilder};
/// use std::sync::OnceLock;
///
/// // In order to fetch in a dedicated system thread we need a cursor with static lifetime,
/// // this implies a static ODBC environment.
/// static ENV: OnceLock<Environment> = OnceLock::new();
///
/// const CONNECTION_STRING: &str = "\
///     Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};\
