[features]

# On linux we assume use of a UTF-8 locale. So we set the narrow features implying that for queries,
# connection strings and error messages the driver and driver manager supply utf8-strings. This
# might also be slightly faster since no transcoding between UTF-8 and UTF-16 is required.
# Overall speed always depends on the driver, but it is reasonable to assume this is faster, more
# importantly, UTF-8 is likely to be more battled tested on these platforms, while UTF-16 is "only"
# required by the standard.

# On windows we can not assume the default locale to be UTF-8, so we compile odbc-api with default
# features implying the use of UTF-16 for queries, connection strings and error messages. This
# should work on any system. However if you would like to use the narrow UTF-8 function calls on
# windows systems you can set this feature flag.

# but only ascii, or want to use the wide functions calls for any other reason on a non-windows
# system you can set the `wide` feature flag to overwrite this behavior.
