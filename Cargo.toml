# On linux we assume use of a UTF-8 locale. So we set the narrow features implying that for queries,
# connection strings and error messages the driver and driver manager supply utf8-strings. This
# might also be slightly faster since no transcoding between UTF-8 and UTF-16 is required.
# Overall speed always depends on the driver, but it is reasonable to assume this is faster, more
# importantly, UTF-8 is likely to be more battled tested on these platforms, while UTF-16 is "only"
# required by the standard.
